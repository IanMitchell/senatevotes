## Tracking Unpopular Senate Votes

This website helps visualize how many votes in the US Senate have been unpopular over the past years.

## Development

This is a pretty standard Next.js website - reading the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) will help you understand this website a lot.

With Node.js 12+ installed, run the following commands:

    $ npm i
    $ npm run dev
  
 The website should be visible at localhost:3000
